      <h1>Spike's Background</h1>
      <img class="spikeseye"src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/cowboybebop/images/0/06/4FC6EAD24102070018.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20171130154605" alt="spikeeye">
      <p class="spikepara1">Spike was born on June 26, 2044 on Mars. Not much is known about the 27-year-old's family or childhood apart from his grandmother dying before he was born. Some speculate he was an orphan and his parents died when he was young.

Throughout the series, there are some clues given about his past. It can be presumed that he was raised in one of the slums of Mars before becoming a thug, a thief, and then finally a criminal affiliated with the <strong><em> Red Dragon Crime Syndicate </em></strong> where Mao Yenrai, head of the organization takes him under his wing.

The criminal organization becomes a kind of like a family for Spike, and, thanks to his skills, he manages to become, in a short time, one of the top men, even being considered by many in the Red Dragon to someday be the leader. He loses his right eye in an unknown accident, which occurred in a mission on behalf of the Red Dragon, after which he was implanted an artificial eye.</p>

<p class="spikep1">After joining the Red Dragon, Spike meets a woman named <strong><em>Julia</em></strong> during a pool game. It is implied that he falls in love with her at first sight. He also encounters Vicious. The two have a shared history and are shown to have fought and worked together in the past, possibly at one point being good friends. However, both become candidates for a possible successor to Mao as the leader of the organization. While Vicious is ambitious, selfish, ruthless, and willing to do anything to get the leadership role, Spike instead finds no interest in the opportunity. The difference of opinion between the two gives rise to a great mutual hatred, as well as, a strong rivalry. Yet, this is not the only reason the two have to hate each other as both desire the same woman. At about this time, Spike is involved in a shooting, plausibly not with the police but with assassins working for Vicious. He survives and is rescued and nursed back to health by Julia. The two become lovers.
It is unclear exactly what links Vicious and Julia, though it seems most likely that Julia was somehow subdued by Vicious and obliged to obey him. Some elements reveal she might have had a romantic relationship with him, further explaining Vicious's anger at Spike for engaging in an affair with her.<p>

<div class="">
<p>Spike is dissatisfied with his current condition and intends to fake his death and escape. He invites Julia to leave the Red Dragon and join him in starting a new life with him. On a rainy day, they're scheduled to meet in a cemetery. Vicious, having learned of their plans, offers Julia the option to preserve her life and regain her freedom in return for killing Spike, stating that if she does not kill him, they would both perish. Julia, unwilling to murder the man she loves, chooses to hide in order to protect both him and herself. She skips the graveyard, leaving Spike to wait in the rain. Spike finally chose to go, and their relationship came to an end in a horrible way. Spike still refers to Julia as "his woman" and "his other half" years later.

Sometime in 2068, in circumstances that are not told, Spike meets Jet Black who becomes his partner and friend. They embark on the ship known as the Bebop and quickly become the most feared bounty hunters of the Solar System. Despite the passing years, Spike continues to search for his beloved Julia.</p>
